I hope this is clear enough and understandable so that you may learn fairly quickly. All you will need is some square paper, your hands, and some determination.If there are any spots that aren't clear, please comment so that I may make it more understandable.The pictures below will be some of the things you will learn how to fold.",

An easy way to remember is that when folded, it looks like a vally (pic 1).  Vally fold from one corner to a corresponding corner.  It sould now look like Picture 2.Then vally fold the side corners to the top point, like in Picture 3.Then vally fold the two corners you just folded to the bottom (pic 4).  Rotate 180 degrees.Vally fold the same two corners to the sidesto make the horn things, like in Picture 5.Now, take the bottom flap and vally fold part of it up, not all the way. (pic 6)Vally fold the rest of the flap up, like in picture 7, and then flip over.You can do two things with this flap.  Tradittionally, it is vally folded upward, but you can tuck it inside the helmet if you want.  Picture 8 is what it should look like traditianally.  Fortucking it in, look at picture 9.  You need to preform a mountan fold (pic 9) and then tuck it as far up in the helmet as you can get it.If you have completed this, you have a Kabuto, and you know how to do mountran and vally folds.",

Unfold.  Fold all four corners to center. (Pic 2)Cupboard Base: Fold a book base. Unfold. Vally fold the two edges to the center crese.(Pic 3).Kite Base: Vally fold one corner to a coresponding corner.  Unfold.  Vally fold two sides of the same angle to meet the middle crease (Pic 4).Square Base: Fold in half horizantally and vertically.  It should now be in 4ths.  Flip over and fold in half from corner to corner.  Collapse (Pic 5). Waterbomb Base: Fold upper-left coner to meet bottom-right corner, and again from the bottom left corner to the upper right.  The two lines should intersect in the middle of the paper.  Flip over and fold in half vertically.  This crease should cross the intersection of the diagonal creases.  Take the points where the vertical crease meets the edge of the paper, and fold them to the bottom.  Press it flat and you should have it!Bird Base: Make a square base.  Fold two flaps in tword the middle crease.  Repeat behind.  Fold upper triangle down as far as it can go.  Unfold.  Repeat behind.  Unfold to the square base.  Take the bottom corner and fiold up along the creases you just made.  Repeat behind (Pic 7).As you can see, there's a lot of bases.",

Now instead of undoing this fold as you did before, you want to simply close up the left door of the cabinet with the right triangle still folded up inside of it.8. Now this is probable one of the hardest steps in making this type of origami so bear with me :)   Start out by lifting up the top right hand corner's door as far as it will go without undoing the folds. Then take the whole top left hand corner and tuck it underneath the right top flap. You want to keep pushing it in until it forms a triangle, the same as the one perpendicular to it.",

You're almost done now!Notice that there are points (the two triangles that hang off of the square in the center) and there are pockets (the 4 little slots on the other side of the square). As you probable guessed you are going to put the points into the pockets. But an important thing before you begin, don't use the two pockets that would cover up the point of that shape if a unit was inserted into one of them.Try experimenting to make the shape. It is kind of like a puzzle. If you get stuck try making 4 pyramids by putting 3 units together to form a 3 sided pyramid-esk shape and then put them together. Experiment!",
