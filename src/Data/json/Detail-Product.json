When I see the joy on their face after they fold their first figure, that is payment enough.  So I decided to make an Inastructable, seeing there was not an origami one for beginners.  I hope this is clear enough and understandable so that you may learn fairly quickly. All you will need is some square paper, your hands, and some determination.If there are any spots that aren't clear, please comment so that I may make it more understandable.The pictures below will be some of the things you will learn how to fold.",

Again, I hope this is clear to understand.In this step you will learn how to fold an Origami Kabuto, or Samari Helmet.Start off with a vally fold.  An easy way to remember is that when folded, it looks like a vally (pic 1).  Vally fold from one corner to a corresponding corner.  It sould now look like Picture 2.Then vally fold the side corners to the top point, like in Picture 3.Then vally fold the two corners you just folded to the bottom (pic 4).  Rotate 180 degrees.Vally fold the same two corners to the sidesto make the horn things, like in Picture 5.Now, take the bottom flap and vally fold part of it up, not all the way. (pic 6)Vally fold the rest of the flap up, like in picture 7, and then flip over.You can do two things with this flap.  Tradittionally, it is vally folded upward, but you can tuck it inside the helmet if you want.  Picture 8 is what it should look like traditianally.  Fortucking it in, look at picture 9.  You need to preform a mountan fold (pic 9) and then tuck it as far up in the helmet as you can get it.If you have completed this, you have a Kabuto, and you know how to do mountran and vally folds.",

Base folds are what models normally start out with.Book Base: Vally fold one edge to the oppisite edge (Pic 1).Bintz Base: Make a book base. Unfold. Rotate 90 degrees. Fold another book base. Unfold.  Fold all four corners to center. (Pic 2)Cupboard Base: Fold a book base. Unfold. Vally fold the two edges to the center crese.(Pic 3).Kite Base: Vally fold one corner to a coresponding corner.  Unfold.  Vally fold two sides of the same angle to meet the middle crease (Pic 4).Square Base: Fold in half horizantally and vertically.  It should now be in 4ths.  Flip over and fold in half from corner to corner.  Collapse (Pic 5). Waterbomb Base: Fold upper-left coner to meet bottom-right corner, and again from the bottom left corner to the upper right.  The two lines should intersect in the middle of the paper.  Flip over and fold in half vertically.  This crease should cross the intersection of the diagonal creases.  Take the points where the vertical crease meets the edge of the paper, and fold them to the bottom.  Press it flat and you should have it!Bird Base: Make a square base.  Fold two flaps in tword the middle crease.  Repeat behind.  Fold upper triangle down as far as it can go.  Unfold.  Repeat behind.  Unfold to the square base.  Take the bottom corner and fiold up along the creases you just made.  Repeat behind (Pic 7).As you can see, there's a lot of bases.",

Vally fold the side flaps so they line up with the middle seam.  Repeat behind. (Pic 1)Vally fold both of the legs up, fold back down (pic 2)Inside reverse fold the legs. (pic 3 and 4)Vally fold the wings down. (pic 5)Vally fold the head to the size you want it, then inside reverse fold.

Now print lines on it (see attached file) then cut it using either method A or B that have been described in step 2.Tips:The wider the strip is, the longer it needs to be to make a good star.Also, The lighter the paper is, the longer the stripes need to be.Therefore the file attached to this step might no be compatible with the kind of paper you've chosen, so experiment a bit.",

Fold each of the four corners of the sheet, so that they meet at the 1/4 fold mark that you created earlier.5. Fold the top and bottom edges to also meet at the 1/4 fold mark.6. Using the diagonal crease that you created in step 3, take the right corner of the paper and fold along the crease. Take the left edge of the corner and fold the flap to the right while simultaneously folding the bottom edge up.7. Rotate the model 180 degrees and repeat step 6.8. Tuck in the corner/flap that you've just folded under the bottom edge pocket created in step 6. At this point, you should have a parallelogram.9.

  "content_2": "ow the first step making this type of origami is to make the first unit!1. Start with a single piece of origami paper with the color side facing down and fold it in half.2. Next, unfold that. Then bring up the paper edge to the crease just you made in step 1 and fold that down.3. Rotate the paper 180 degrees and repeat step 2 with the paper edge.4. Rotate that by 90 degrees so you're looking at something like a cupboard. Open the left side door of the cabinet and fold up the bottom right corner up to the crease of the opened left side.5. Undo the right triangle you made in step 4 and close up the left side of the cabinet.",

  "content_3": "6. Then rotate this by 180 degrees and open up the new left side. Then repeat step four by folding up the right hand bottom corner up to the crease of the left door to the cabinet.7. Now instead of undoing this fold as you did before, you want to simply close up the left door of the cabinet with the right triangle still folded up inside of it.8. Now this is probable one of the hardest steps in making this type of origami so bear with me :)   Start out by lifting up the top right hand corner's door as far as it will go without undoing the folds. Then take the whole top left hand corner and tuck it underneath the right top flap. You want to keep pushing it in until it forms a triangle, the same as the one perpendicular to it.",

Fold up the 2 points of the shape to form a square.11. Lastly you just want to fold the square diagonally in half, along the gap between the two points you folded down in step 10. You may fold them in either direction. ",

  "content_5": "Now that you have 12 completed units, it is now time to put them together. You're almost done now!Notice that there are points (the two triangles that hang off of the square in the center) and there are pockets (the 4 little slots on the other side of the square). As you probable guessed you are going to put the points into the pockets. But an important thing before you begin, don't use the two pockets that would cover up the point of that shape if a unit was inserted into one of them.Try experimenting to make the shape. It is kind of like a puzzle. If you get stuck try making 4 pyramids by putting 3 units together to form a 3 sided pyramid-esk shape and then put them together. Experiment!",
